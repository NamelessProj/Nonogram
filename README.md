# Nonogram

[The live demo](https://namelessproj.github.io/Nonogram/)

My goal for this project wasn't to do something good looking, but to do something that work.

I was only interested on trying to understand the mechanics and how it works. 

If you're interested by my work, it's free to you to redo the CSS as you want.
